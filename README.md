# gpxtrackmerger
A simple tool that display a map and the posibility to drag & drop GPX tracks for showing together. Once you drag it, the track appears on the map. 
The next track will be displayed on the same map with a different color and so on.
Great when you want to put together the activities from a holiday, from an area etc.
