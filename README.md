GPX Tracks Merger tool made in React that display a map and the posibility to drag & drop GPX tracks for showing together. 
Once you drag it, the track appears on the map. 

The next track will be displayed on the same map with a different color and so on.

Useful when you want to put together all the activities from a holiday :)
